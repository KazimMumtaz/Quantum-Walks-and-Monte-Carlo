## 🧾 Project Summary

Explore how quantum circuits can simulate complex systems through a Galton Box-style Monte Carlo problem, an approach relevant to high-dimensional challenges like particle transport and quantum systems.
This project builds on the foundations of the Quantum Fourier Transform and its potential for exponential speed-up over classical methods.​​
